    "# Default Probability Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook estimates the probability of bank defaults under two different models: a **coupled** system and an **independent** system. The simulation tracks the minimum asset value for each bank over time and counts a default when that minimum falls below a threshold.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simulation, we model the dynamics of banks using a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with the Euler-Maruyama method. We simulate two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coupled system** – In this model banks interact via the term `a * (mean_X - X)`, so that the evolution of each bank depends on the mean across banks.\n",
    "2. **Independent system** – In this model the banks evolve independently based on random shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each simulation, we keep track of the running minimum for each bank, and count a default if the minimum ever goes below a predetermined level **D = -0.7**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters are used in the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N:** 10  \n",
    "  Number of banks. With 10 banks, default counts range from 0 to 10.\n",
    "- **T:** 1.0  \n",
    "  Total simulation time.\n",
    "- **dt:** 0.001  \n",
    "  Time step for the simulation.\n",
    "- **steps:** Computed as `T / dt`  \n",
    "  Total number of simulation steps.\n",
    "- **a:** 10  \n",
    "  Interaction parameter (used only in the coupled system).\n",
    "- **sigma:** 1.0  \n",
    "  Volatility representing the intensity of the random shocks.\n",
    "- **D:** -0.7  \n",
    "  Default threshold, where any bank whose running minimum falls below this value counts as having defaulted.\n",
    "- **n_sim:** 10,000  \n",
    "  Number of Monte Carlo simulation runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `simulate_dynamics(coupled=True)` carries out the simulation for either the coupled or independent model. For each simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**  \n",
    "   Each bank’s asset value starts at zero, and the minimum value is also tracked from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Evolution:**  \n",
    "   For each time step:\n",
    "   - Compute the Brownian increment for each bank.\n",
    "   - For the **coupled** case:  \n",
    "     Update the bank’s value using the term `a * (mean_X - X)` where `mean_X` is the average across banks.\n",
    "   - For the **independent** case:  \n",
    "     The bank value is updated solely based on the noise (i.e., `sigma * dW`).\n",
    "   - The running minimum is updated for each bank during the evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Default Counting:**  \n",
    "   At the end of each simulation path, the number of banks that have defaulted (i.e. where the running minimum goes under D) is recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histogram and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the simulations for both the coupled and independent systems, histograms are computed to represent the probability distribution of the number of defaults. The histograms are normalized so that the y-axis represents a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **x_vals:**  \n",
    "  The number of defaults (from 0 to N).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **hist_coupled:**  \n",
    "  Normalized histogram for the coupled simulation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **hist_independent:**  \n",
    "  Normalized histogram for the independent simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The final section of the notebook produces a plot with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plots the histogram for the coupled system using a solid blue line.\n",
    "- Plots the histogram for the independent system using a dashed blue line.\n",
    "- Axis labels for the number of defaults and their probability.\n",
    "- Customizations for the x-axis ticks and limits to clearly display the 0 to N defaults.\n",
    "- A legend to distinguish between the two simulation cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a quantitative analysis of default probabilities by:\n",
    "- Simulating bank asset values using SDEs.\n",
    "- Comparing the default behavior under coupled versus independent dynamics.\n",
    "- Visualizing the loss distribution to gain insights into systemic risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "By varying parameters such as the interaction strength, volatility, and default threshold, further investigations can illuminate the factors contributing to systemic risk in banking systems."
